        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, I am a web developer in training. I live in cottonwood heights near salt lake city Utah. I enjoy spending time with my family, going to movies, hiking, snowboarding and finding hot springs around the edges of the valley. I am currently learning JavaScript and adding to my toolbelt daily languages and frameworks.</p>
